Introduction:

My name is Brendan Premo. I was born October 21, 1998 and am a passionate nerd who loves working on data projects. This folder is my work during my time 
as a dual graduate student in Mathematics and Data Sicence at SUNY Albany, along with some side projects I've worked on during the past decade or so. My 
current project is updating my workbase as a student to be corrected of any mistakes and published on Github as a compentent portfolio.

I am currently employed as a Data Analyst at Soria Analytics, working with the BI tool Sigma Computing and doing some software development on the internal
codebase. Some of the analysis work I've done is also in this portfolio.

Background:

Ever since I was in Elementary school, I had an affinity for mathematics. I was well adept in the basics and quickly became more advanced as I grew older,
only wishing I was given more of a push to pursue more advanced topics sooner than I was. I finished with 5's in Calculus AB and BC before my Senior year 
and took Multivairable Calculus my Senior year at Hudson Valley Community College.

I graduated High School in 2016, during which in my Senior year I was placed in an advanced engineering program called Questar 3: New Visions (STEM) where 
I spent half of my days on the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) campus. The program required we be matriculated in Physics 1 & 2 at RPI, along with 
doing engineering projects and research. I started learning to code in Python and Java during this time, and haven't stopped since.

After being impressed with the campus, I was accepted to join the class of 2020 of RPI, pursuing a degree in Aerospace Engineering. I soon realized that this
wasn't a good fit for me and, after switching paths numerous times, found myself seeking to return to my mathematics roots.Through many tribulations, including 
mental health issues steming from overwork, stress and the COVID-19 epidemic, I graduated RPI in 2021 with a Bachelors in Applied Mathematics. 

I took a year off from schooling after getting the privilege to work as a Bartender in the Adirondacks, a position I've always wanted to hold. I was active
until the winter, when commuting from my permanent address became too dangerous to be worth the decreased traffic. I found work in other places nearby,
but quickly found I didn't enjoy it as much. I began working for my father as a farm hand on our property, caring for the livestock we have, feeding and 
watering them, maintaining their pastures and other odds and ends that need doing. While I do not need to be working every hour of every day, I do need to
be prepared for anything. I've learned heavy machinery operation, a plethora of tools and on-the-fly decision making. I've done landscaping, wood
processing, fence/coop building and many other one-off things that would take too long to list.

I started taking classes at SUNY Albany in 2021 to finish my Bachelor's degree and enjoyed the staff and campus enough to apply to complete my Master's in
Mathematics. After a year of classes and talking with the administration, I found a passion for TDA and Machine Learning, and wanted to begin pursuing a
degree in Data Science instead. I was convinced to do both, and in 2025, I graduated as the first dual Master in Mathematics and Data Science from 
University at Albany.


Present:

Since my graduation, I've been adapting all of my works from Graduate school and the side projects I've done to be compatible with Github so that employers or
interested parties could see the work that I've done. Most of my efforts at the moment are modifying my preexisting programs to work on my offline machine, 
as most of my work was done on the cloud-based platform Google Colab, as well as updating my older works to be more reflective of my current capabilities.
If the project/problem was older with a correct solution, I've left my old work as a comparison to a newer implimentation that I feel is more in line with
what I would produce as a data analyst/scientist.

In the Summer of 2025, I got the opportunity to work at a pre-seed startup called Soria Analytics as a data analyst, working in a BI tool called Sigma 
Computing. During this time, I was taught how to use the BI tool for analysis and data cleaning, as well as some mild software development scraping data
from API sources, doing analysis in Python and SQL, and learning as much as I could about the healthcare space. You can find the work that I've done 
during my time in the soria_work folder. Most of the scripts will not work due to them being off the codebase, but the analysis I did for the Star Ratings
is fully functional and has some enrollment mapping from another CMS source towards the end. 


School Projects:

Below are outlines/summaries for the school projects in this folder. Most of these documents are works in progress for updating, but since most are graded 
works done in a Jupyter Notebook, the documents can be read regardless. Titles followed by an asterisk are in the process of being updated. Titles without 
a summary in this document have not yet been started to be updated. All other summaries can be interpreted as completed works:

Application Documents - This is a folder with my current resume, a general cover letter and my unofficial transcript for my graduate education.

Stochastic Processes F23 (*) - This folder holds a master document of the work I was required to do during Intro to Stochastic Processes, as well as any data 
files required. I was awarded a A for my work, but much of it needed to be updated. I've conglomorated all of the interesting theory problems and most if not
all coding questions. Topics covered in this document include: Monte Carlo Simulations, Bayesian Statistics, Markov Chains, PageRank, Natural Language 
Processing (NLP), Beam Search and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). This work is a Jupyter Notebook containing Python and LaTeX.

Horse Game - For Christmas one year, my Uncle had us play a board game he called "Horse Racing", where you would bet on a horse corresponding to a number 
that can be rolled on a pair of dice (2-12). Each horse had a number of pins needed to traverse to reach the finish line and win. I noticed that the 
distribution of pins needed to win for each horse seemed unbalanced based on the probability of rolling dice, that is certain horses had an unfair advantage 
to other horses. I wrote a MonteCarlo simulation to prove this was the case (there was a sizable advantage for horses of rolls 2 and 12), as well as a means 
to change the number of required pins for each horse to win to try and even the odds.

Darts - A simple program that keeps track of the score for a game of Darts.
