        "Beam Search is a breadth-first search to find the most likely output sequence from the given data. In the case our data is a text document with sentences, Beam Search aims to output the sentence most likely to occur based on the words in the text, taking into account sentence structure (i.e., understanding that certain words tend to appear before certain other words based on probability of appearance). For example: $P(\\text{'I', 'like', 'to', 'eat', 'apples'}) > P(\\text{'apples', 'like', 'to', 'eat', 'me'}).$\n",

        "We can do this with a Markov Model, where each word is a \"token\" and we keep track of what other tokens they preceed, giving them a probability of what word would come next in an arbitrary sentence containing that token. This is a Markov model since sentences are in of themselves chains of words, so certain words are more likely to occur prior to another, i.e. $P(\\text{apple}|\\text{eat}) > P(\\text{eat}|\\text{apple}).$ With one prior, this is called \"Unigram\", and if we increased the number of priors to two, it would be \"bigram\", then \"trigram\" and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this problem, you will generate a model trained on all of the sentences in the novella. With this trained model, you will then generate the sentence most likely to generate when fed a specific word. As a sanity check, the token \"time\" is very likely to be succeeded by \"traveller.\" For this, we will only consider the unigram case.\n",
