        "This analysis was done in a sequential form. A lot of misinterpretations are kept in for a majority of the models generated simply due to lack of thinking at the time as a way to preserve the methodology used to reach conclusions about these misinterpretations without damaging the learning process made prior to learning about them.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a way, this document is a story about how we go from the baseline above to the final model, ensuring to include each step made with the reasonings behind each feature inclusion, removal and transformation, rather than just a culmination of the process made to showcase the best model while all the busy work is left behind the scenes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The downside to this approach is a lot of the code in the latter half relies on certain decisions made in the Intro section. While this isn't too big a deal (the processing time of the data after the Data Screening section is less than 10 seconds), it does lead to a lot of difficulties for modifying the dataframe later on. Because of these creative decisions, there is plenty of optimization to be done to this document.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first is a data split at the beginning of the Data Screening section. This would reduce the total memory constraints on the document, as we wouldn't be constantly needing to store the entire data file, when we never use more than a fourth of it after the Data Screening section. The reason this wasn't done was due to a lack of foresight about needing to eventually work with the entire dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second stems from the first. With an increase in memory, it woud be ideal to have a \"host\" dataframe apart from the main one to house all of the features we are currently using, would want to use, and no longer are using, so that adding and removing features from a model generation is as simple as skimming the desired features from the host dataframe. You can see this approach to a lesser extent in the Model Simplification and Improvement section, but the full development of such a technique was passed on for the sake of the afforementioned creative liberty."

It's important to remember that this dataset is holding \"housing\" data, but could also include apartment complexes and so on, thus is actually a \"property\" dataset. For example, just looking at the number of unique values in 'Type', we see the list is massive, mostly due to poor formating on part of the feature itself, but we see *SingleFamily, Apartment, Townhouse, Condo, (Low, Mid,Hi)-Rise (1-3, 4-8, 9+), Luxury* and *Commercial* just to name a few different types of property.\n",

This is due to the inclusion of \"None\" or \"No Data\" in many of the features' cells. While dealing with this problem isn't too difficult for AutoGluon in terms of a gerneral model generation, it spawns some issues with how we wish our data to be received by AutoGluon on a case-by-case basis (when to and not to treat \"None\" as a 0, or as a literal \"No Data\" entry).\n",

Our preliminary model smashed that score, achieving $\\text{RMSLE}_{\\text{prelim}} = 0.107$. This is quite close to the soft end goal score of $\\text{RMSLE}\\le.08,$ so it's safe to say we are on the right track.\n",

With the number of features tried in these models, there must be a potent feature with a low entry count that we simply didn't consider because they didn't stick out in the mass of higher data dense features available to us.\n",

This very well could have been a mistake, and AutoGluon was improving the model with superior preprocessing. It could also be the case that AutoGluon was finding value where it shouldn't, leading to fake improvements in the score. The truth to this is hard to pinpoint, but what is true is the score was better when we didn't take the preprocessing into our own hands.\n"
