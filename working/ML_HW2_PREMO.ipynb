Q3: Random Fourier Features (50pt)\n","This question is going to answer why Homework 1 Q2.4 works so well.\n","\n","Kernel methods such as Logistic Regression are considered memory-based learners. Rather than learning a mapping from a set of input features $\\mathcal{X} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ to outputs in $\\mathcal{Y}$, they remember all training examples $(\\mathbf{x_i}, y_i)$ and learn a corresponding weight for them.\n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","    \\hat{f}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\omega_i k(\\mathbf{x_i}, \\mathbf{x})\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","After learning the weight vector $\\mathbf{w} = [\\mathbf{w}_1, ..., \\mathbf{w}_N]$, we can make prediction on unseen samples using the **kernel function** $k$ between all training samples and $\\mathbf{x}$. Kernel methods are attractive because they rely on the \\textit{kernel trick}. Any positive definite function $k(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}')$ with $\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}' \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ defines a function $\\psi$ mapping $\\mathbb{R}^d$ to a higher-dimensional space such that the inner product between datapoints can be quickly computed as $\\langle \\psi(\\mathbf{x}), \\psi(\\mathbf{x}') \\rangle = k(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}')$. In essence, the kernel trick is an efficient way to learn a linear decision boundary in a higher dimension space than that of $\\mathcal{X}$.\n","\n","The kernel trick can be prohibitively expensive for large datasets. This is because the memory-based algorithm accesses the data through evaluations of the kernel matrix $k(x, x')$ which grows in proportion to the dataset size $N$.\n","\n","Instead of relying on the implicit feature mapping $\\psi$ provided by the kernel trick, suppose we can approximate the kernel function $k$ as the inner product of two vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^D$. Mathematically, we would like to find a mapping $\\mathbf{z}$.\n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","    \\mathbf{z} : \\mathbb{R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^D \\qquad \\text{such that} \\qquad k_p(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}') = \\langle \\psi(\\mathbf{x}), \\psi(\\mathbf{x}') \\rangle \\approx \\langle \\mathbf{z}(\\mathbf{x}), \\mathbf{z}(\\mathbf{x}') \\rangle\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","With this approximation, we no longer require the kernel trick to express $\\langle \\psi(\\mathbf{x}), \\psi(\\mathbf{x}')\\rangle$ as $k(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}')$.
