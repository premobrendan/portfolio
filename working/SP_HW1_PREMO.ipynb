    "If we assume we are at step $i$ at the start, then we have a probability $p$ to go to step $i+1$ and a probability $q$ to go to step $i-1$ with no probability to go anywhere else, so then the $i^{th}$ row of $P^X$ is $P_i^X = [ ... , q, 0, p, ...  ]$ where the $...$ indicates that the rest of the vector is 0's. Since Y is simply taking two steps of X,  we have a probability $p^2$ to go to 2 steps forward, i.e. $i+2$, a probability $q^2$ to go 2 steps backward, i.e. $i-2$ and a probability of $pq$ to go either one step forward then one step back, or a probability of $qp$ to go either one step back then one step forward, where we stay at step $i$ for either, thus the probability of staying at step $i$ is $2pq$. So the $i^{th}$ row of $P^Y$ is $P_i^Y = [ ... q^2, 0, 2pq, 0, p^2, ...  ]$, where the $...$ indicates that the rest of the vector is 0's. This does indeed form a Markov Transition Matrix since $p+q=1$, so for each row of $P^Y$, we have $p^2+2pq+q^2 = (p+q)^2 = 1^2 = 1$. Thus, $P^Y$ (centered at the $i^{th}$ row and column) is:\n",
