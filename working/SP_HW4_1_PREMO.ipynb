This probability is a simple Markov Chain where going forward has probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$, so to get two heads in a row, we take $\\frac{1}{2^2}=\\frac{1}{4}$ and for $k$ heads in a row, the probability is $\\frac{1}{2^k}$.\n",

For a tail on roll 2, we consider the probability of getting a head then a tail, which is $\\frac{1}{2^2}=\\frac{1}{4}$, as well as the number of rolls, which is $A+2$, which gives the term $\\frac{1}{4}(A+2)$.

For example, THHH has THH before HHH. So, the only way we could have HHH appear prior to THH is if the very first three flips in the sequence are heads, since after the first tail is flipped, any continued sqeuence of heads is started by a tail, thus we'd get THH before HHH.
